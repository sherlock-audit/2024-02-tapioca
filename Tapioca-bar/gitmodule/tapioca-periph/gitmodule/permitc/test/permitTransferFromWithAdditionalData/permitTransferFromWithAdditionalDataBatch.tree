// The batch implementation of permitTransferFromWithAdditionalData allows for an array fo token IDs to be transferred via a single signature while checking for additional signature data
// This signature has a token address, ID, amount, nonce, operator and expiry in addition to whatever additional data is defined
// If any of these values are invalid, the signature will be rejected
// The signature is generated by the token owner and sent to the operator
// If the signature resolves to any address aside from the token owner, the signature will be rejected
